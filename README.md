# RAMStack
## Introduction

Ramstack is a collection of guidelines to build a full stack for web and natives apps, with the following characteristics:

 - ***Reliability***: The app is predictable, in correctness and performance, even in the presence of errors. The stack is capable of self-healing hardware and software faults.
 - ***Availability***:  The app is capable of overcoming faults in the stack and keep functioning, eventually returning to a consistent state. 
 - ***Maintainability***: Fixing bugs and adding new features should be easy. Developers can use any tool they prefer and it's easy to adapt to changing business requirements.

The stack as a whole aims to be ***anti-fragile***: an increase in load will be met with an increase in reliability and availability, faults are used to adapt robustness thresholds, big data is the center of future business decisions.

One of the main ideas behind this stack is to move the load balancer and part of the cache in the client, thus creating a ***smart client***, decoupled from the frontend, to provide an offline-first experience . This can be seen as an extension of Google's PWA

## Why RAMStack?

### Performance is a feature

### Availability means trust

### Business speed is crucial

### Machine learning to the rescue

## Where are the libraries?

### Stay close to the metal

JQuery was king, JS fatigue

### Node.JS and Rust

### Javascript and React

### MongoDB and Redis

## Frontend

## Backend

## Hybrid Cloud

### C10M problem with 300 euros per month
