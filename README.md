# RAMStack
## Introduction

Ramstack is a collection of guidelines to build a full stack for web and natives apps, with the following characteristics:

 - *Reliability*: The app is predictable, in correctness and performance, even in the presence of errors. The stack is capable of self-healing hardware and software faults.
 - *Availability*:  The app is capable of overcoming faults in the stack, eventually returning to a consistent state. 
 - *Maintainability*: Fixing bugs and adding new features should be easy. Developers can use any tool they prefer and  

The stack as whole aims to be anti-fragile: an increase in load will be met with an increase in reliability and availability,
