# RAMStack
## Introduction

Ramstack is a collection of guidelines to build a full stack for web and natives apps, with the following characteristics:

 - *Reliability*: The app is predictable, in correctness and performance, even in the presence of errors. The stack is capable of self-healing hardware and software faults.
 - *Availability*:  The app is capable of overcoming faults in the stack and keep functioning, eventually returning to a consistent state. 
 - *Maintainability*: Fixing bugs and adding new features should be easy. Developers can use any tool they prefer and it's easy to adapt to changing business requirements.

The stack as a whole aims to be *anti-fragile*: an increase in load will be met with an increase in reliability and availability, faults are used to predict robustness thresholds

## Why RAMStack?

### Performance is a feature

### Availability means trust

### Business speed is crucial



## Where are the libraries?

### Node.JS and Rust

### Javascript and React

## Frontend

## Backend

## Hybrid Cloud
