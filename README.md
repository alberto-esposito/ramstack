# RAMStack
## Introduction

Ramstack is a collection of guidelines to build a full stack for web and natives apps, with the following characteristics:

 - ***Reliability***: The app is predictable, in correctness and performance, even in the presence of errors. The stack is capable of self-healing hardware and software faults.
 - ***Availability***:  The app is capable of overcoming faults in the stack and keep functioning, eventually returning to a consistent state. 
 - ***Maintainability***: Fixing bugs and adding new features should be easy. Developers can use any tool they prefer and it's easy to adapt to changing business requirements.

The stack as a whole aims to be ***anti-fragile***: an increase in load will be met with an increase in reliability and availability, faults are used to adapt robustness thresholds, big data is the center of future business decisions.



## Why RAMStack?

### Performance is a feature

### Availability means trust

### Business speed is crucial

### Machine learning to the rescue

## Where are the libraries?

### Node.JS and Rust

### Javascript and React

### MongoDB and Redis

## Frontend

## Backend

## Hybrid Cloud

### C10M problem with 300 euros per month
